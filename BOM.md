The sled is approximately 12" in diameter with a UHMW (very slippery low friction plastic trim) and weighs about 12 lbs.  By the time you add all the component weights together the final sled will be about 25 lbs.   Z axis is 200mm long.
See our assembly page for easy step by step instructions. Takes about 15 minutes to assemble.  Please note the base is spray painted black. One will have to use moderate pluge rates for best results. We recommend no more than 1/8" at a time.
